Analysis

Based on Chart 1, generally theater kickstarters in the US have a decent rate of success. In fact, based on information in Chart 2, the best time to have the kickstarter would be during the month of May or June. Table 1 also has allowed us to determin that failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. This may be a problem as Louise is setting her goal at twice the amount the average successful Kickstarter goal. Pledges also play a key factor as both the mean and median of pledges are lower for unsuccessful kickstarters. However, Looking at the table we also note that in failed Kickstarters, the standard devation is three times the IQR indicating that failure may have just been due to overly ambitious goals. This is visually represented in Chart 3.

Thus for Louise to help increase her chance for a success, she can keep the idea of a play as they tend to be successful. She should try to produce the play for less than ~4,000 Euros as that is the upper quartile for the total of sucessful campaigns.

Analysis

From the chart "Outcomes based on Goals", we see a comparison of the percentage successful play kickstarters to the percentage of failed play kickstarters. It is immediately noted that the two lines mirror each other. This is due to the fact that there were no canceled plays. What is seen from the successful percentage line is that as the goal (y-axis) increases, generally, the percentage of successful plays decrease. There is an exception in the 35,000 to 39,999 and 40,000 to 44,999 range. A trend is shown in the failed line where fails increase as the goal increases. These indicate that goals should be kept on the lower side to increase chance of success. However, this is likely only be due to an higher ease of meeting the lower requirements of the lower goals and not actually reflect conditions required to meet goals. A possibly better way of looking at goals versus success would be to use it as a guage of difficulty in meeting goals and not as an indicator of wether success would occur from a set goal. Then it would be possible to guage a range Louise can obtain from her Kickstarter. Another factor we need to be careful of is that the graph is based on percentages. If a sample size was not large, it is possible that the data is not representing the information proportionally. It is possible for the 35,000 to 39,999 and 40,000 to 44,999 goals, there were relatively few plays that had that goal, but just so happened to meet them. Thus in addition to this graph, a table of counts would be helpful in determining how the outcomes were affected by goals.
