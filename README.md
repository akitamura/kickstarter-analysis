Analysis

Based on Chart 1, generally theater kickstarters in the US have a decent rate of success. In fact, based on information in Chart 2, the best time to have the kickstarter would be during the month of May or June. Table 1 also has allowed us to determin that failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. This may be a problem as Louise is setting her goal at twice the amount the average successful Kickstarter goal. Pledges also play a key factor as both the mean and median of pledges are lower for unsuccessful kickstarters. However, Looking at the table we also note that in failed Kickstarters, the standard devation is three times the IQR indicating that failure may have just been due to overly ambitious goals. This is visually represented in Chart 3.

Thus for Louise to help increase her chance for a success, she can keep the idea of a play as they tend to be successful. She should try to produce the play for less than ~4,000 Euros as that is the upper quartile for the total of sucessful campaigns.
